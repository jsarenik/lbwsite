<h1>Linuxbierwanderung Alfriston 2010</h1>
<p>Mr. David Cantrell and Mr. David Harris cordially invite you to join
  them in <a href=http://wikiproxy.cantrell.org.uk/Alfriston>Alfriston</a>
  for a week of hacking, drinking, walking, and assorted other Frolics.
  We think that Alfriston is an excellent venue for an LBW, as it has plenty
  of good walking in the nearby hills, a multitude of local beers, plentiful
  accomodation, and it's easy to get to.</p>

<h2>The Dates</h2>
<p>Several hundredweight of the finest dates will be imported by sea-going
  camels specially commissioned from the Kingdom of Morocco, between
  25 Jul and 1 Aug.</p>

<h2>The Cost</h2>
<p>As always, the LBW will be funded by donations from attendees.  The suggested donation is &pound;15, &euro;20, or CHF25, but this is <em>not</em> compulsory.  If you can't afford to donate, please turn up anyway.

<h2>The Hall</h2>
<p><img align=left src=http://www.cantrell.org.uk/david/photos/alfriston-sep2008-jan2009/THUMB-main-hall.jpg>
  We will be based in the Memorial Hall, next to the village green and
  church on one side, and riverside meadows on the other.  It has one large
  hall, one smaller hall that would be used for talks, and a well-equipped
  kitchen.  The premises have a licence for the sale of alcohol, so we will
  be able to have the traditional barrel of special LBW beer.

<h2>Walking</h2>
<p>There is lots of good walking in the area, with convenient pubs to stop
  for refreshment in most of the villages.  There are walks suitable for
  a wide range of abilities and fitness levels.

<h2>Beer</h2>
<p>Sussex - the county in which Alfriston lurks - has a great many small
  breweries.  The nearest major brewery is Harveys in Lewes, who brew
  several ales, mostly fairly hoppy.  There are also local cider producers
  and some small vineyards producing prize-winning wines.

<h2>Accomodation</h2>
<p>The village has three pubs which also let out rooms, several bed and
  breakfasts, a couple of hotels, and a youth hostel.  There is more
  accomodation in some of the surrounding villages within easy walking
  distance.

<h2>Travel</h2>
<p>Alfriston is well-signposted from the main A27 road.  There is a railway
  station nearby, with direct trains to/from Ashford International (for
  those using the Eurostar), Gatwick Airport, London Victoria, and Brighton.
  Ferries from Dieppe dock in Newhaven a few miles away.

<h2>Other</h2>
<p>For the non-geeks, there's a lot to do in the area.  There are numerous
  castles, gardens, museums etc.  Brighton is only a very short trip with all
  that it has to offer.
