<h1>LBW Alfriston 2010: The Hall</h1>

<p>The village hall was recently refurbished and extended.  It now has a large hall with a capacity of about 150 with a small stage.  From this hall, doors open onto a small meadow which slopes down to the river.  Off to one side of the hall is a well-equipped kitchen.  Behind and to the side of the stage is another smaller room which we would use for talks and tutorials.  The building is accessible throughout for wheelchairs, and already has wireless interwebnet.</p>
