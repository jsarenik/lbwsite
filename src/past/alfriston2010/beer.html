<h1>LBW Alfriston 2010: Beer (and other things)</h1>

<p>Sussex is blessed with many breweries.  The most well-known is <a href=http://www.harveys.org.uk/>Harveys</a> in the nearby town of Lewes.  The rest are listed <a href=http://www.brightoncamra.org.uk/Breweries.html>here</a> by <a href=http://www.brightoncamra.org.uk/index.html>Brighton CAMRA</a>.  Your correspondent particularly enjoys beers from <a href=http://www.darkstarbrewing.co.uk/>Dark Star</a>, <a href=http://www.hammerpot-brewery.co.uk/>Hammerpot</a>, and <a href=http://www.thebeerstation.co.uk/>Hepworth</a>.</p>

<p>The best ciders in England - and therefore the best in the world - are also brewed in and around Sussex.  The nearest cider-maker is <a href=http://www.middlefarm.com/07_cider_perry.htm>Middle Farm</a>, who also run a shop selling well over 100 different ciders, beer from most of the local breweries, English wines, spirits and liqueurs, and other local produce.  We hope to have a barrel of local cider in the hall, and maybe to arrange a trip to see cider being made.</p>

<p>Vines are grown in several places in southern England, the best of the local vineyards being <a href=http://www.breakybottom.co.uk/mainindex.htm>Breaky Bottom</a>.  We hope to arrange a trip here too.</p>
