<p>We have a low traffic <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/linuxbierwanderung">mailing list</a> for
discussing the forthcoming events and remembering past ones.
Alternatively you can join us in <abbr title="Internet Relay Chat">IRC</abbr> at #lbw on <a href="http://www.oftc.net/">OFTC</a>.

<p>You may be able to find some hikers on <a href="http://www.ofcom.org.uk/static/archive/ra/publication/ra_info/ra357.htm">PMR446</a>, using channel 4, CTCSS 7.

<p>To let us know that you are coming, please use our shiny
<a href="http://lbw.draiocht.net/accounts/login/">registration system</a>.
To prevent spam, registrations need to be manually approved, this normally doesn't take more than a
couple of days.
